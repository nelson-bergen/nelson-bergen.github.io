                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>Manufacturing had determined that a sensor in one of our products was experiencing reliability issues, resulting in abnormally high pressure readings that triggered safety alarms. A theory proposed by our team was that pressure hammering was occurring as a result of rapid valve closure, which may have been causing mechanical deformation of the sensor body.</p>
                
                <p>I was then tasked with leading an investigation to determine whether or not pressure hammering was occurring in our system.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="work-section">
                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                
                <h3 style="color: #34495e; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.8rem 0;">Developing the Test Strategy</h3>
                <p>I developed a series of tests to measure the presence of pressure hammering within the system and to see what variables impacted the amount of variation in system pressure. This included analyzing the device's fluid pathway, improper use by the user, and the sudden closure of valves due to emergency alarms.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #34495e; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.8rem 0;">Overcoming Measurement Limitations</h3>
                <p>In order to bypass the limited resolution of the system's built-in data measurement utility, I connected the sensor directly to an <span class="highlight">oscilloscope</span> in order to catch very quick pressure spikes indicative of pressure hammering. With the help of a senior technician and member of the electrical engineering team, I learned how to amplify the signal using a fixture and cleaned the signal using a capacitor.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #34495e; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.8rem 0;">Automating Data Collection</h3>
                <p>I wrote a <span class="highlight">Python script</span> that communicated with the oscilloscope using SCPI standards in order to automate data collection. The script automatically recorded key pieces of information such as maximum voltage and frequency upon the tripping of a rising voltage level trigger. This automation significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of data collection.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="work-section">
                <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
                <p>Using this test fixture, I was able to document the pressure waveform within the system's fluid pathway and show that there was potentially evidence of pressure hammering within the system. Although it was later determined that another phenomenon was responsible for the pressure sensor reliability issue, my test did prompt further investigation into the possibilities of pressure hammering within the system.</p>

                    <p><br>Through this experience I learned how to observe modify and record signals from a circuit. I improved my coding abilities learning how to write Python code in order to communicate with physical hardware. Finally, I gained experience using my theoretical engineering knowledge investigate the root cause of a real life phenomenon, developing my ability to design and perform tests.</p>
